# Cancer Modelling in Python

This repository contains mathematical and computational models for cancer dynamics,
with a focus on tumour growth, stochastic effects, and treatment optimisation.

## Current Progress
- Deterministic tumour growth model (logistic growth) implemented in `01_basic_tumour_growth.ipynb`

## Tools
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab

## Roadmap
1. Parameter sensitivity analysis
2. Stochastic tumour growth models
3. Spatial (PDE-based) tumour models
4. Treatment optimisation
5. Hybrid mechanistic + ML models
